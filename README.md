# 🐊 Project Description

This project was created for the GovHack 2024 challenge [Crocodile Watch: Enhancing Public Safety](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/crocodile_watch_enhancing_public_safety) by the Northern Territory Government.

Croc N Tell is a mobile app designed to improve public safety by providing real-time updates on crocodile sightings, predicted hotspots, and the ability for users to report their own sightings with ease. Our goal is to raise awareness and protect communities through accessible, crowd-sourced data and trusted government sources.

**Croc N Tell** is a mobile app designed to enhance public safety by providing **real-time updates** on crocodile sightings, **predicted hotspots**, and allowing users to **easily report** their own sightings. Our mission is to empower communities by providing access to **crowd-sourced** and **trusted data** from government sources, fostering awareness and keeping people safe in crocodile-prone areas.

### Overview

The Northern Territory is known for its rich outback, tropical towns, and ancient Aboriginal culture, making it an ideal destination in Australia. However, it’s also home to **over 100,000 saltwater crocodiles**, up from just 3,000 in the 1970s. With **five crocodiles per kilometre** of waterway, these **apex predators**, which can live up to 70 years and grow over 7 meters long, pose a serious threat to local communities and tourists. Between 2005 and 2018, there were 17 reported crocodile-related fatalities, including a tragic incident in 2024 when a young girl was fatally attacked near Mango Creek.

**Croc N Tell** provides the tools to **navigate the Northern Territory safely**, offering **real-time data** on crocodile locations, and an intuitive platform for **reporting sightings**. By providing reliable and easy-to-access information, our goal is to increase awareness and **reduce the risks** associated with crocodile encounters.

### 💡Solution

# 📊 Data Story

### Overview

While some government data on crocodile sightings is available, it is limited. We leverage this existing data to gain insights into trends while developing a solution to gather more comprehensive data through user reports. Croc N Tell fills the gaps by encouraging users to report sightings and integrating satellite technology, improving the overall quality and coverage of crocodile data.

### 🔍 Data Insights

![Data Visualization](./images/data%20visualisation/data1.png)

Here’s what the data tells us:

1. **Crocodile Distribution**: Croc maps reveal where crocodiles are most prevalent across the Northern Territory.
2. **Monthly Captures**: The app analyzes monthly crocodile capture data over the past 20 years, highlighting patterns in behavior and activity with **March and April** being the most dangerous months for encounters..
3. **Species Analysis**: Insights into the types of crocodiles captured, identifying which species pose the most significant risks.
4. **Temperature and Activity Trends**: Contrary to popular belief, **temperature has little effect** on crocodile activity. Crocodiles remain active all year debunking the myth that higher temperatures affect their activity.
5. **Risk Analysis**:Using historical data and machine learning, we assess the risk of encountering a crocodile, classifying it as low, moderate, high, or very high. Based on the risk level, we generate safety alerts, advising caution or notifying authorities if necessary

### 📈 Usage

**Croc N Tell** leverages **open data** from the Northern Territory Government to provide **insights** and **predictive trends**about crocodile activity. In addition to government data, the app collects **crowd-sourced reports** from users and utilizes **satellite imagery** to offer a comprehensive view of crocodile movements.

By allowing users to submit photos, videos, and detailed reports, Croc N Tell improves data accuracy. Sighting reports are flagged for reliability based on the amount of information provided—those with photos, videos, timestamps, and locations are considered highly reliable.

We are also integrating **satellite technology** to track crocodile movements in real time. Satellites have successfully been used to monitor the behavior and migration patterns of other wildlife, such as **elephants, whales**, and **sharks**, allowing us to adopt these methods to improve public safety and provide more accurate **crocodile activity alerts**.
